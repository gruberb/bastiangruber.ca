I was in university, and was writing for the German MacWorld (<a href="https://www.macwelt.de/">Macwelt</a>) at the time. Dropbox was gaining more popularity, and the phone wars were just heating up. In my mind, it would have been a dream to have a proper, built-in cloud storage so I didn't have to manually sync my iMac and MacBook Air.</p><p>Be careful what you wish for. MobileMe ceased to exist. It was a horrible slog to use, and the best part of this service was my shiny @me.com E-Mail address which I still have. iCloud is now fast, and every service in Apple's ecosystem is bundled under one platform.</p><p>In a way that makes it intentionally hard to switch services or add other devices. I recently started a new job, had to give up my company MacBook, and thought to myself: I need a backup machine. I ordered the Framework laptop and put Arch + <a href="https://system76.com/cosmic">COSMIC</a> on it. I use Firefox and Thunderbird, but had no way of integrating iCloud Drive in a nice way into my backup setup.</p><p>Few months down the line, and COSMIC entered the beta version. It is stable and fast. I fell deeper in love with my Framework laptop, which released a 2.8k 120Hz screen (finally), which I could just order and install myself (in less than 5 minutes).</p><p>I also fell in love with tinkering again, and felt constrained by the whole Apple ecosystem. To a point where every device but the Apple TV seems like a drag to use these days. So, time to break up with Apple (again).</p><hr><h2>The problem with bundling</h2><p>Here's what I realized: Apple bundles four things that should be separate.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Layer</th><th>What it is</th><th>The Apple trap</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Identity</strong></td><td>How the world reaches you</td><td>Your @icloud.com address — they own it</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Data</strong></td><td>Files, photos, passwords, calendar</td><td>All in iCloud, all in one account</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access</strong></td><td>How you connect securely</td><td>Their devices, their rules</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Recovery</strong></td><td>Getting it back when things break</td><td>&quot;Trust us&quot;</td></tr></tbody></table><p>One account suspension, one forgotten password, one &quot;suspicious activity&quot; flag — and all four collapse at once. Your email address, your photos, your passwords, your files. Gone.</p><p>I don't think Apple is going to lock me out. But I also don't want my digital life to depend on that assumption.</p><hr><h2>My existing setup</h2><ul><li>I already owned a very small, dedicated server with OVH. But it was not very powerful (4GB of RAM, low storage, 100Mbit/s up/down, located in France — I live in Canada now, so slow pings). I configured NGINX, had domains pointed to the IP address, had existing SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt and other small services deployed on it.</li><li>I have 3-4 domains registered with GoDaddy.</li><li>I use it as my DNS server via <a href="https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html">AdGuard Home</a>.</li></ul><h2>My goals</h2><p>I wanted a more powerful server, more RAM, bandwidth and also a faster ping. I wanted a built-in VPN, so certain services are forced to use a VPN connection or break by default. I wanted to host my own photos, files, calendars and contacts. I want an easy enough backup solution which runs by itself to a second, remote location.</p><hr><h2>How I went about it</h2><p>The thought of setting up a whole self-hosted infrastructure seemed more than daunting. So many services to run and maintain, different installation scripts, docs which are probably outdated or don't exactly fit my particular needs etc.</p><p>But hey, we have a shiny new toy at our disposal: LLMs. It seemed to be perfect for this use case.</p><p>In my experience and usage, LLMs are vaguely helpful here. They can nail a solution, or lead you off stray if you are not careful in your planning phase. I was overwhelmed with transitioning and keeping existing files, and which services to use for calendars, contacts, photos, file sync, DNS, media handling, and legal torrenting for larger files and backups.</p><p>The LLM output was helpful in a way, where I could ask:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;These x,y,z are my needs. Tell me for File sync every possible self-hosting solution, and create a table with pros and cons. I want to be totally device independent, and it needs good Android, iOS, Linux and macOS apps or integration&quot;.</p></blockquote><p>This helped me get to know solutions I maybe wasn't aware of. I did this with every category to get a first overview what's out there.</p><p>Turns out, I knew every solution and was also aware of its pros and cons. But good to know anyway.</p><hr><h2>What I chose</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Apple Service</th><th>Replacement</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>iCloud Keychain</td><td>Vaultwarden</td><td>Bitwarden-compatible, all the apps just work</td></tr><tr><td>iCloud Drive</td><td>Seafile</td><td>Fast, handles large files, decent mobile apps</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Photos</td><td>Immich</td><td>ML-powered search, face recognition. Impressive.</td></tr><tr><td>Calendar</td><td>Radicale</td><td>Simple CalDAV, native iOS/macOS support</td></tr><tr><td>Contacts</td><td>Radicale</td><td>CardDAV, same deal</td></tr><tr><td>Apple Music</td><td>Jellyfin</td><td>Media server for music and video</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>Transmission</td><td>Torrents, routed through VPN</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>WireGuard + Mullvad</td><td>VPN for specific services</td></tr><tr><td>—</td><td>AdGuard Home</td><td>DNS server</td></tr></tbody></table><p>For email, I went with <a href="https://migadu.com">Migadu</a>. Small Swiss company, straightforward pricing. I own the domain, they handle the mail. If they disappear, I point my MX records elsewhere and keep my address. That's the key thing — the address is mine now.</p><hr><h2>How it went</h2><p>The real power doing this with LLMs was the guided step-by-step procedure without having to have hundreds of tabs open. I purchased a new dedicated server with OVH (this time: Intel Xeon, 64GB RAM, 2x2TB drives, located in Canada), and while I waited for the setup to be complete, I logged into my old server and told Claude which services I ran and where the file locations of each of these were.</p><p>I then printed every config to the terminal (<code>cat /path/to/config</code>) and copy pasted the whole terminal output. I pasted it in Claude and said: &quot;This is my setup, I want to re-create it on my new server.&quot;</p><p>It then just told me the <code>sudo apt install</code> commands and printed out the updated configs for each service, so I could just copy paste and move on. It even suggested to use a <code>tmux</code> session for the larger <code>rsync</code> operation from server A to B, so closing the <code>ssh</code> session wouldn't kill it. Obvious, but I am sure I would have closed it by accident, realized it, googled, had an &quot;Aha, of course tmux&quot; moment and looked for all the right commands on some random blog post.</p><blockquote><p>I wish LLMs would credit all their sources more. I love these blog posts, and using them subconsciously through a LLM feels just wrong.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>The VPN routing trick</h2><p>I wanted Transmission to always go through Mullvad, but not everything else. Turns out you can do this with WireGuard and policy-based routing.</p><p>Transmission runs as a specific user (UID 103 on my system). I added a routing rule that sends all traffic from that UID through the WireGuard tunnel:</p><div class="code-block-container"><button class="copy-code-button" aria-label="Copy snippet"><svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><rect x="9" y="9" width="13" height="13" rx="2" ry="2"></rect><path d="M5 15H4a2 2 0 0 1-2-2V4a2 2 0 0 1 2-2h9a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v1"></path></svg></button><pre class="language-bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ip</span> rule <span class="token function">add</span> uidrange <span class="token number">103</span>-103 lookup <span class="token number">200</span> priority <span class="token number">99</span><br><span class="token function">ip</span> route <span class="token function">add</span> default dev wg-mullvad table <span class="token number">200</span></code></pre></div><p>Everything else goes direct. Took me a while to get this working — the debugging was annoying but satisfying once it clicked.</p><hr><h2>Backups</h2><p>This is the part I'm most paranoid about, and I think rightly so.</p><p>3-2-1 rule: three copies, two media types, one offsite.</p><ol><li><strong>Live data</strong> on the server</li><li><strong>Encrypted daily backup</strong> to a Hetzner Storage Box (offsite, in Germany) using <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a></li><li><strong>Weekly sync</strong> to an external drive at home</li></ol><p>Daily backups run at 4am via systemd timer. Databases (Immich PostgreSQL, Seafile MariaDB) get dumped to SQL first so the snapshots are consistent.</p><hr><h2>What it costs</h2><table><thead><tr><th>Item</th><th>Monthly (CAD)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>OVH dedicated server</td><td>$38</td></tr><tr><td>Mullvad VPN</td><td>$8</td></tr><tr><td>Migadu email</td><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>Domain</td><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>Hetzner Storage Box</td><td>$6</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total</strong></td><td><strong>~$56</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Compare that to iCloud+ 2TB ($13) + 1Password ($5) + Spotify ($11) + VPN ($8) = ~$37/month.</p><p>So yes, I'm paying about $19/month more. But I have a dedicated server with 64GB of RAM and 4TB of storage. I can run side projects on it. Experiments. Whatever I want.</p></main><aside class="post__aside"><nav class="post__pagination"></nav></aside></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__content"><ul class="hero__social-links"><li><a href="https://github.com/gruberb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bastiangruber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@bastian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastodon</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bastiangruber.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky</a></li><li><a href="https://rustwebdevelopment.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Book</a></li><li><a href="/feed.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS</a></li></ul></div></footer></div><div class="table-of-contents" id="table-of-contents"><h3>Contents</h3><ul class="toc-list" id="toc-list"></ul></div><button class="toc-toggle" id="toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle table of contents"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M3 9h14V7H3v2zm0 4h14v-2H3v2zm0 4h14v-2H3v2zm16 0h2v-2h-2v2zm0-10v2h2V7h-2zm0 6h2v-2h-2v2z"/></svg></button><script src="/assets/main.5b735852a543c384ae82.js"></script><script>const copySvg = `
