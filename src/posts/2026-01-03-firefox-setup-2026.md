This blog post should serve as a time capsule for my future self. How was it like serving the Internet in 2026? What is my set up, my most visitied bookmarks, websites I frequently go to? Let's find out.

### Hardware excursion 

For the very first time, I cleanly separated my work (MacBook Pro M3 Pro) and my private digital life (Framework AMD 13" with Arch + COSMIC). I deinstalled all work related apps and logins from my phone (iPhone 13 Pro Max). I use Firefox on all devices, Thunderbird on my Framework laptop (and use GMail via the browser on my work laptop). On my iPhone, I use the default Mail client. I also [unplugged completely from Apple](https://bastiangruber.ca/posts/mass-quitting-apple/) and hope to get a [GrapheneOS native Android phone soon](https://tbot.substack.com/p/grapheneos-new-oem-partnership).

### My (Firefox) extensions

- [Are.na](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/are-na/)
- [Bitwarden Password Manager](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/)
- [Bypass Paywalls Clean](https://gitflic.ru/project/magnolia1234/bpc_uploads/blob/?file=bypass_paywalls_clean-latest.xpi&branch=main)
- [Hide shorts for Youtube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hide-youtube-shorts/)
- <del>[I still don't care about cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/istilldontcareaboutcookies/)</del>
- Someone on lobste.rs pointed out [Consent-O-Matic](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/consent-o-matic/)
- [SponsorBlock for YouTube - Skip Sponsorships](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)
- [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/)
- [YouTube Enhancer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-enhancer-vc/)
- <del>[AdBlocker for YouTube](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-for-youtube/)</del>
- <del>[ClearURLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls/)</del>
- <del>[Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17/)</del>
- A commenter pointed out these are redundant if you use uBlock Origin (which has URL tracking protection and tracker blocking built-in). Firefox also has "Copy Link Without Site Tracking" in the right-click menu now.

#### Configuring uBlock Origin for maximum coverage

Open uBlock Origin settings (click the extension icon → three gear icon) and go to **Filter lists**. Make sure these are enabled:

**Privacy section:**
* EasyPrivacy (replaces Privacy Badger)
* AdGuard/uBO – URL Tracking Protection (replaces ClearURLs)

**Ads section:**
* EasyList

uBlock Origin's built-in filters (enabled by default) handle YouTube ads specifically—no extra configuration needed.

Click "Update now" at the top, then "Apply changes".

### Web Services I use

- [TickTick](https://ticktick.com) for ToDos
- [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/) for finances
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for diagrams
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) for...so many things honestly. I disable my <del>browser</del> watch history so no video recommendations and rabbit holes for me, perfect!
- [Miniflux - Self hosted](https://miniflux.app/) for my own RSS needs 
- [WakingUp](https://app.wakingup.com/) for meditation
- [GitHub](https://github.com/gruberb) for my coding projects.

### Go-to websites I often browse

0. [isthelclcpoolopen.ca](https://isthelclcpoolopen.ca/) - A dashboard I created for our local community pool.
1. [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/)
2. [Are.na](https://www.are.na)
3. [Popular Pinboard posts](https://pinboard.in/popular/)
4. [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/)
5. [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
6. [NewsMinimalist](https://www.newsminimalist.com/)
7. [Letterbox](https://letterboxd.com/)


### Flow

I often times open the browser mindlessly, click on the suggested shortcuts in Firefox of my last visited websites, and see what's new. Once a day or around 3 times a week, I check my RSS feed. I really enjoy going to the websites directly, and RSS seems to... clean and stripped down. But I also don't want to check 15 blogs manually every day, so it's good enough. 

I save websites (articles really) to my [Are.na account](https://www.are.na/bastian-foreach-me-com/channels) and promised myself to read it later. Which... I barely do. I started a TickTick list with an every day task to read at least 2 articles from my ["Aha! Coding"](https://www.are.na/bastian-foreach-me-com/aha-coding) channel. And I want to read more papers and watch tutorials this year. It's always a nice attempt, and once work is heating up, I read up on so many things I need at that moment, that I don't have much time or energy left to read "general purpose" content. But every time I come across a new problem, I find a saved article months later which would have helped me - at least partly - with that. So I want to make a new attempt of being religious about reading tech articles again.

[HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is still one of my most visited website. I barely read the comments anymore, maybe the first one. But it's a good hub to know what's generally going on in the wider industry. Same with [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/), but I enjoy going through the comments there, even of posts I am not interested in. [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/popular/) is another one where I go through the popular saved articles, but don't use the service myself anymore.

For meditation and introspection, I enjoy [WakingUp](https://app.wakingup.com/). It's sometimes "too far out there", but it's less cluttered than the other suppose-to-be meditation apps. And I still need some prompts or guidance, especially during a hectic day with work, family, hobbies and friends.

For my ToDos: I actually managed to have 0 ToDo apps during most of 2025. They always stress me out seeing all the open things in my life I currently can't make progress on. Work is manged separete, and life is happening so much at the moment with kids and family, that the top 3-5 priority tasks are always obvious. But I also realized I am missing out on cleaning out my (digital) life and experimenting with project ideas or blog posts. It's good to have a place to store them again. I start to use [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/). I wish OmniFocus, Things and TickTick would have a baby. But TickTick is the best multi-platform tool I found, and it's "good enough". I really miss going nerdy in OmniFocus, and I miss the sheer beauty and simplicity of Things. But oh well. Can't have it all it seems.

I mange my finances for the past 15 years with [YNAB](https://www.ynab.com/). It is slowly not the best tool anymore, and I want to try [Monarch](https://www.monarch.com/), but their Canadian bank account support doesn't seem to be working reliably. But hey, they actually have a [dashboard](https://www.monarch.com/connection-status) for it!

Coding projects still live in [GitHub](https://github.com), and it slowly time to self host my projects. I never really collaborate much on these projects, but just want to store them somewhere where I can run workers. I would miss the hosting static websites via GitHub pages, so I have to figure out how to do that. 

A bigger part takes [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/). I listen to DJ sets, follow a few channels and often times watch tutorials or talks on it. YouTube is I think the only service which I am very happy to pay money for. Now it's owned by Google and I am sure there are some shady things going on with pushing videos front and center. I disabled my watcb history, so I see a black blank page when I open the general website. **I have three YouTube bookmarks**:

- Subscription view
- "Watch it later" playlist
- My own "Music" playlist

So I never browse YouTube mindlessly, and get no video recommendations (disabled also via one of the YouTube extensions).

That's it - that's my setup. I use [Firefox Sync](https://www.firefox.com/en-CA/features/sync/) to have my account stored not only on my laptop, and as soon I setup Firefox somehwere else, all my extensions and bookmarks are back. And I trust Mozilla with my data (I work there and can talk to the folks and they are all great :)).

I don't expect that I change this setup very much in 2027 - the web feels much slower to change, but I still want to have this noted down somewhere.
